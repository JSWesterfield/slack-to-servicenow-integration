# Slack To ServiceNow Integration

ðŸ“²ðŸ“¥Slack To ServiceNow Api is a NodeJS application for creating a service now ticket within Slack and pushing this to the ServiceNow API

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/) 

```bash
npm install slackToServiceNowApi
```

## Usage

We set up our application by adding the below code:

```javascript

const { createEventAdapter } = require('@slack/events-api');
const slackSigningSecret = process.env.SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET;
const slackEvents = createEventAdapter(slackSigningSecret);
 
// Read the port from the environment variables, fallback to 3000 default.
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
 
(async () => {
  // Start the built-in server
  const server = await slackEvents.start(port);
 
  // Log a message when the server is ready
  console.log(`Listening for events on ${server.address().port}`);
})();


```
